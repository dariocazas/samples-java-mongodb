# Mongo Server

This folder contains a basic docker-compose file that runs two services:

* MongoDB Server: standalone server with one node, without replica set. Util for testing in local environment
* [Mongo Express]: Web-based MongoDB admin interface written with Node.js, Express and Bootstrap3

However, you can run the samples over you own configuration, follow the [MongoDB installation guide]
